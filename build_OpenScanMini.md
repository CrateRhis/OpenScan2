# OpenScan Mini with Polarizer Module

## Overview
The OpenScan Mini is a compact desktop 3D scanner capable of scanning objects up to ~8-10 cm with an accuracy of up to 0.02 mm. The frame can be fully 3d printed, and all other components are off-the-shelf parts. You should be able to source all parts locally, or chose to support the OpenScan project by ordering (some) parts through [Openscan.eu/shop](https://www.openscan.eu/shop). Currently, the following cameras can be used without any additional modifications: Arducam IMX519 16mp & autofocus, Pi Camera v2 8mp and Pi Camera v1.3 5mp, where the Arducam IMX519 has to be considered the gold standard (for now :)

## Bill of material (BOM)

## 3D Printing
Get the printable .stl (and design) files [here](https://github.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan-Design/tree/main/OpenScanMini).

**PRINTER**
- you will need a print-bed of at least 200x200mm
- depending on your printer's capabilities (and your risk aversion), all parts can be fitted onto one build plate of min. 220x210mm
- printing all parts can be done in under 17h (tested on Prusa MK3S+ using default Draft profile)

**PRINT SETTINGS**
- support: no (* except for 07_polarizer_b
- layer-height: 0.2-0.3 mm
- print speed: depends on your printer's calibration

**MATERIAL**
- COLOR - main Frame: Please use a material without visible particles or structure. Avoid transparent materials
- COLOR - 07_polarizer_a: translucent/natural
- COLOR - 07_polarizer_b: any non-translucent material (like PETG black, Prusament Galaxy Black) 
- PLA is totally fine, since there is not a lot of mechanical strength needed
- PETG, ABS, ASA can be used for increased temperature resistance in warm environments
