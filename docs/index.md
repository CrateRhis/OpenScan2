# OpenScan - 3D Scanner

OpenScan is a modular concept, which can be used to build your photogrammetry based 3d scanner. You can simply use the individual modules and adjust it to your needs
(i.e. firmware, 3d printed design, PCB, photogrammetry cloud processing ...). The center piece is a Raspberry Pi driven camera/motor controller, which can be used to drive various photogrammetry rigs. 
Currently, there are two major hardware designs available - the OpenScan Classic and Mini. The devices are controlled by the OpenScan Firmware, which is based on the Node-Red browser interface.

The project is based on the contribution of many great and open-minded people by doing tutorials on Youtube, comments on Reddit, publications on GitHub and many other places. Without all those voluntary contributors, this project would not be possible at all. There is a little [TODO guideline](TODO) on how you can join the project and make it even greater :)

## Documentation - Build and setup your scanner
