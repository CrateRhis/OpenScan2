# OpenScan2 - 3D Scanner

## Overview
Here you can find everything you need to know in order to build your own 3D Scanner. The OpenScan concept is very modular, so that you can take individual parts and adjust it to your needs (i.e. firmware, 3d printed design, PCB, photogrammetry cloud processing ...). The center piece is a Raspberry Pi driven camera/motor controller, which can be used to drive various photogrammetry rigs. Currently, there are two major hardware designs available - the OpenScan Classic and Mini. Everything is controlled by the OpenScan Firmware, which is based on the Node-Red browser interface.

**Note, that I am currently centralizing all the information and manuals, that were created since 2018, into this repository. If you are looking for anything in particular, feel free to join the [discussions](https://github.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan2/discussions) or open an [issue](https://github.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan2/issues).**

## Contribution and contributors

The project is based on the contribution of many great and open-minded people by doing tutorials on Youtube, comments on Reddit, publications on GitHub and many other places. Without all those voluntary contributors, this project would not be possible at all. Please feel free to join the discussions and development preferably in this repository or on [r/OpenScan](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenScan/), [Facebook - LowBudget3DScan](https://www.facebook.com/groups/142108429832711) or [OpenScan.eu/forum](https://openscan.eu/forum)
